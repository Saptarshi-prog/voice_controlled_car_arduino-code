# voice_controlled_car_arduino-code
This repository contains the arduino code for voice controlled car. 
This is the code to control a car using voice commands. The communication is based on bluetooth module hc-05. I have given the basic commands to move in the four directions namely forward, backward, left and right and some garbage values. You may change the value according your need.
